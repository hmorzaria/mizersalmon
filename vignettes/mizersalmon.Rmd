Data from spreadsheet biological_parameters_fg, saved as mizer_biodata.csv
Includes age at maturity, initial biomass
Other data needs to be estimated 

```{r}

data(mizerbiodata)


groups.catch <- extract_catch()

# join with biomass, summarise over boxes, so its species, cohort, timestep
groups_biomass_catch <- groups.catch %>% 
  left_join(
    biomass_bySpeciesTimestep, by = c("Code","ts")
  ) %>% 
  mutate("Effort" = Catch/Biomass) %>% 
  rename(Timestep = ts)

```
